/**
 * If I am going to use Twilio
 * 
 * API Route: /api/handle-response
 * 
 * Twilio webhook endpoint to handle customer voice responses in real-time.
 * Receives customer's audio, sends it to GPT (i think we will use 4o) for generating AI replies,
 * Then triggers Text-to-Speech (google and then ElevenLabs) to respond back to the customer via the call.
