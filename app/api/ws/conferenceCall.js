// conferenceCall.js

/**
 * ‚ñåSUMMARY:
 * - This script uses Twilio's REST API to initiate TWO outbound calls:
 *     1. Customer ‚Üí joins conference (can speak, hears beep on enter/exit)
 *     2. Agent ‚Üí joins same conference (can speak, no beep)
 * - Both parties are routed through the same TwiML endpoint (/conference-join),
 *   which defines the <Conference> behavior.
 * 
 * ‚ñåHOW TO USE:
 *   1. Update the ngrok URL to point to your live TwiML server (/conference-join).
 *   2. Run this script with: node conferenceCall.js
 *   3. Both users will receive a call and be joined into the "zeus_sales_demo" room.

/* summary of how it works

Call both the agent and the customer.

Join them into the same Twilio conference room.

Unmute the customer and agent so both can talk.

Beep only plays when customer joins or leaves, not agent.

Stream audio to your AI WebSocket if the participant is unmuted (AI side).

Let AI respond in real-time via your server.js

*/

/* things added

BEEP if customer joins/leaves (only customer)
