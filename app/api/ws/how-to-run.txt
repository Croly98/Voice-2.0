Updated Configuration:

  - Conference Server (port 3000): https://ff3c1c367f6a.ngrok-free.app
  - AI Server (port 3001): https://8cbef3e3f118.ngrok-free.app

  To test:

  1. Set your Twilio webhook to: https://PORT3000.ngrok-free.app/voice (port 3000)
  2. Run the conference server: node app/api/ws/twilio-conference-with-ai.js
  3. Run the AI server: node app/api/ws/ai-server-for-conference.js
  4. Call your Twilio number from the moderator phone (+353861790710)



  1. Added Second Participant Configuration - Added constant for second participant number (+353861790710)
  2. Updated Conference State - Changed from single aiCallSid to array outboundCalls to track multiple
  participants
  3. Created Helper Function - addParticipantToConference() handles outbound calling logic for any participant      
  4. Modified Conference Start Handler - Now calls both AI bot and second participant in parallel when
  conference starts
  5. Added New Endpoint - /participant-join-conference endpoint for regular participants (with beep, unlike AI      
  bot)
  6. Enhanced Call Status Tracking - Single /outbound-call-status endpoint handles status for all outbound
  calls with proper logging
  7. Updated Conference End Handler - Terminates all active outbound calls when conference ends
  8. Improved Logging - Better console output showing configuration and tracking of all participants

  How It Works Now:

  1. When the moderator (+35319079387) calls and joins the conference
  2. Conference starts and triggers two parallel outbound calls:
    - AI Bot (+35319079387) â†’ joins with WebSocket stream to AI server
    - Second Participant (+353861790710) â†’ joins as regular participant
  3. Both participants are tracked in the outboundCalls array
  4. When conference ends, all outbound calls are terminated automatically

  The system now properly handles multiple outbound participants with error handling and comprehensive logging      
  for monitoring the conference state.
