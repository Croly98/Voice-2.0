Updated Configuration:

  - Conference Server (port 3000): https://ff3c1c367f6a.ngrok-free.app
  - AI Server (port 3001): https://8cbef3e3f118.ngrok-free.app

  To test:

  1. Set your Twilio webhook to: https://PORT3000.ngrok-free.app/voice (port 3000)
  2. Run the conference server: node app/api/ws/twilio-conference-with-ai.js
  3. Run the AI server: node app/api/ws/ai-server-for-conference.js
  4. Call your Twilio number from the moderator phone (+353861790710)



  1. Added Second Participant Configuration - Added constant for second participant number (+353861790710)
  2. Updated Conference State - Changed from single aiCallSid to array outboundCalls to track multiple
  participants
  3. Created Helper Function - addParticipantToConference() handles outbound calling logic for any participant      
  4. Modified Conference Start Handler - Now calls both AI bot and second participant in parallel when
  conference starts
  5. Added New Endpoint - /participant-join-conference endpoint for regular participants (with beep, unlike AI      
  bot)
  6. Enhanced Call Status Tracking - Single /outbound-call-status endpoint handles status for all outbound
  calls with proper logging
  7. Updated Conference End Handler - Terminates all active outbound calls when conference ends
  8. Improved Logging - Better console output showing configuration and tracking of all participants

  How It Works Now:

  1. When the moderator (+35319079387) calls and joins the conference
  2. Conference starts and triggers two parallel outbound calls:
    - AI Bot (+35319079387) ‚Üí joins with WebSocket stream to AI server
    - Second Participant (+353861790710) ‚Üí joins as regular participant
  3. Both participants are tracked in the outboundCalls array
  4. When conference ends, all outbound calls are terminated automatically

  The system now properly handles multiple outbound participants with error handling and comprehensive logging      
  for monitoring the conference state.

  node app/api/ws/ai-server-for-conference.js

  2. Start the conference server:
  node app/api/ws/twilio-conference-with-ai.js

  3. Call your main Twilio number (+16073094981) from the moderator phone (+35319079387)
    - Conference will start
    - Both AI bot and second participant will be called automatically

  The test script helps verify your outbound calling works before testing the full conference flow.




  ‚úÖ Fixed! Here's exactly how to run everything:

  üì± Step 1: Twilio Console Setup

  1. Go to https://console.twilio.com
  2. Navigate to: Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Active Numbers
  3. Click on +16073094981

    - A call comes in: Webhook
    - URL: https://ab1b98fd5611.ngrok-free.app/voice
    - HTTP Method: POST
  5. Click Save

  üñ•Ô∏è Step 2: Start the Servers

  Terminal 1 - Start AI Server:
  cd C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\voice\Voice-2.0
  node app/api/ws/ai-server-for-conference.js
  You should see:
  [AI Server] Running on port 3001
  [AI Server] WebSocket endpoint: wss://c8e02326e543.ngrok-free.app/media

  Terminal 2 - Start Conference Server:
  cd C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\voice\Voice-2.0
  node app/api/ws/twilio-conference-with-ai.js
  You should see:
  Conference server running on port 3000
  - Main Number: +16073094981
  - AI Bot Number: +35319079387

  üìû Step 3: Start the Conference

  Call +16073094981 from the moderator number (+35319079387)

  What happens:
  1. Conference starts when moderator joins
  2. System automatically calls:
    - You at +353861790710
    - AI bot at +35319079387
  3. Both join the conference with WebSocket streaming enabled
  4. You can talk with the AI in real-time

  ‚úÖ Verification:

  - You'll hear "Connecting you to the Zeus Conference"
  - AI will join saying "Thalia from Zeus Packaging is joining the conference"
  - Both terminals will show connection logs
  - You can speak and the AI will respond naturally

  The AI bot now properly joins the conference with streaming enabled using the <Start><Stream> TwiML structure!
