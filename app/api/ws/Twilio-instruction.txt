1. Make two outbound API calls and add them to a conference.

2. Make a third call to one of your Twilio numbers and add it as a participant to the same conference. Ensure this Twilio number is configured with an inbound route to a TwiML Bin where the incoming call connects to the AI websocket via <Connect><Stream>.

 

This way, you have two real participants and the Twilio number as the third participant in the conference, which separately holds the AI Agent. All audio from the conference is streamed to the AI, and the response or audio from the AI is streamed back to the conference, allowing all participants to hear it.

SECOND MESSAGE

Thank you for your interest in implementing the solution I recommended. While I couldn't find a specific code repository for your exact use case, I can guide you on how to get started with Twilio's bi-directional streaming using the <Connect><Stream> verb.

 Here's a basic outline to help you implement the solution:

 1. Set Up Twilio Functions: Use Twilio Functions to handle the logic for making outbound calls and adding them to a conference. Twilio Functions is a serverless environment that makes it easy to deploy your code.

 2. Create a TwiML Bin: Configure a TwiML Bin to handle incoming calls to your Twilio number. This TwiML Bin will use the <Connect><Stream> verb to connect the call to your AI agent via a WebSocket.

 3. Make Outbound Calls: Use the Twilio API to make two outbound calls and add them to a conference. You can use the Conference TwiML verb to manage the conference participants.

 4. Add AI Agent to Conference: Make a third call to your Twilio number, which is configured with the TwiML Bin. This call will connect to the AI agent and join the conference, allowing the AI to interact with the other participants.

 5. Example Code for <Connect><Stream>:


xml<Response>  <Connect>    <Stream url="wss://your-ai-agent-websocket-url">      <Parameter name="Dtmf" value="False" />    </Stream>  </Connect></Response>
